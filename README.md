Keeps a number of virtual machines running at all time. Easy peasy.

## Why is it named Tartelet?

The app is named Tartelet because it builds upon [Tart](https://tart.run), an open-source CLI for managing macOS virtual machines.
Tartelet makes it easy to run multiple virtual machines using Tart. The Danish word for “easy” is “let” and “Tart” + “let” with an “e” in the middle becomes “Tartelet”. “Tart” + “e” + “let” = “Tartelet”.
[Also, a “tartelet” is a traditional Danish food.](https://www.valdemarsro.dk/tarteletter-hoens-asparges/)
